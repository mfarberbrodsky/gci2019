# Google Code-In 2019
This repository contains tasks I completed with [CCExtractor Development](https://github.com/CCExtractor) during [Google Code-In 2019](https://codein.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/), which I won as a Runner-Up.

## My Tasks

### [TinyDebug](https://github.com/CCExtractor/AZTinyDebug)
This was a series of tasks in which I created a Python debugger / profiler that creates shareable video logs of a program's execution.
